Attempt at building a core language for PanthR to be used for two purposes:

- To represent the key structures used and operations on them (vectors, lists etc)
- To represent dialog and other component interfaces

The expectation is that PanthRLang code would be compiled to Javascript, and create components ready to be integrated into Cujo or other pipelines.
